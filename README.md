# Battleship

C++ version of Monte Carlo Tree Search based algorithm to solve Battleship decision game. Many different player heuristics (e.g. random guessing, calculating probabilities, finding the whole ship after 1 hit...) to compare with implemented MCTS.

Processing version of NEAT neural network with GUI solving the same problem.
